## My process

### Built with

For this first challenge, I decided to only use native HTML5 and CSS3, to focus solely on what I struggle the most, that is, 
semantic HTML and CSS organization.

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- ARIA - Accessibility Rich Internet Applications
- BEM - Block Element Modifier naming convention for CSS
- CDN - Content Delivery Network used for importing the Outfit Google Font
- GitHub Pages for hosting

### What I learned

- The main tag
- Remove unnacessary divs
- How to import fonts with CDN
- Reset CSS to have more control over my styles
```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
- How to use hsl and how it differs from rgba
- How align-content and align-items are different from each other

### Continued development

The main points I still need to develop are:
- Base styles: I struggle a lot on defining the base styles for the pages, that includes:
    - font-family
    - font-size
    - colors
    - themes
    - variables
- Controlling layouts: I have a hard time making the best decisions about padding and margins.
- Working with images: I still haven't really understood when to define images width and height properties.
- Gain more knowledge about ARIA.
